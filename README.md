# OEConnection Platform Engineer take home test

This project is used to complete the OEConnection platform engineer take home test.

This is a simple architecture with a front end project that needs to talk to a backend payments api. 

Make docker files for the two applications.

Build a helm chart for the front end and a separate chart for the payments api and install them on a local minikube server. 

Once the services are running, port forward into the root directory of the front end and capture a screenshot of the output in a browser. 

Once this is complete, return a zip file that contains the screenshot and any infrastructure files that were used to build and deploy the services.
